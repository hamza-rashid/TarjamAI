# TarjamAI: Streamlit-Based Arabic to English Video Transcription and Subtitling

TarjamAI is an innovative Streamlit application designed to facilitate language learning by transcribing and subtitling Arabic MP4 files, such as news videos, into English. This tool harnesses the power of the Whisper API to accurately transcribe audio content and generates subtitles in SRT format.

## Key Features
- **Automated Transcription**: Utilizes Whisper API for efficient and accurate Arabic-to-English translation.
- **Subtitle Generation**: Converts transcribed content into SRT format, ready for subtitling.
- **Video Processing**: Integrates ffmpeg to burn subtitles directly onto video files for an immersive learning experience.

## Current Status
TarjamAI is a work in progress. The project has successfully implemented transcription and subtitle generation. However, it is currently paused due to challenges in processing power required for the ffmpeg video burning process. Please see [TarjamAI - Flask](https://github.com/hamza-rashid/TarjamAI-Flask/tree/main) for my flask application that builds upon this idea to utilise TransloadIt for the video processing. 


## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or solutions to enhance the video processing capabilities, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Stay tuned for further updates as we work towards making TarjamAI a comprehensive tool for language learners and enthusiasts!
